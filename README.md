# EducationalPlatform

This is a Front-End only university project. The project showcases a responsive web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes multiple sections such as About, Skills, Projects, and Contact, along with Login and Signup pages.

### Important clarifications:

- This project is **UI-only** (no backend, no database, no real authentication).
- Login and Signup pages are visual demonstrations only.
- All content is created for academic and portfolio purposes.
- No real user data or backend logic is involved.

The goal is to demonstrate front-end structure, responsiveness, and clean UI design.
